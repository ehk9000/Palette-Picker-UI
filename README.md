# Color Me Newton

## Description 
The goal of this project was to build a color palette generator and store different color palettes in our RESTful API database. The user can add color palettes with unique names, and save them to a project folder. 

The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ehk9000/Palette-Picker-API)

### Learning Goals
*  Solidify our RESTful API design skills and to get familiar with the patterns associated with building a single app across multiple repositories.
* Connecting BE & FE repositories using CORS
* Making use of automatic continuous integration with TravisCI
* Deployment with Heroku
